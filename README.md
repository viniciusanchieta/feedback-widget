## About

Next Level Week Return offered by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) for the community. In this edition, in the Impulse track, a complete and accessible widget was developed that can be used across multiple projects to collect user feedback.

The backend of the application was built with NodeJS using the best practices of testing and with an amazing tool to deal with the database that is Prisma.
On the frontend we used ReactJS and as a builder we used the tool Vite that handled all the bureaucratic part and allowed us to move forward in an
surprising way. In the frontend we also used TailwindCSS which is a big help when it comes to styling and making our app look elegant in a quick and easy way.

The Mobile part was the best, built with React Native and Expo, the application allowed us, consuming the backend, to provide feedback through the cell phone with an 
using good formatting practices, layouts, color variables and fonts.

The impulse track classes were taught by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g) and [Rodrigo](https://github.com/rodrigorgtic).
